Corbin Via Week 4.5: Debugging

Regarding how to avoid bugs, I feel that I am doing some aspects well but need to improve on Git workflow.

Naming variables is something that I feel I do well. I try to use descriptive variables in my code. On CSS documents, 
I put the tag in comments next to the CSS rule to give myself a reminder of what I am editing.

Indenting code is also an important part of writing code for me. I have been consistent with this and intend to continue 
proper formatting of my code.

As far as packing too much code onto one line, I'm not sure if I have been making this error. I have not written very much 
code, but I seem to keep it concise. This along with indenting helps to see what is happening with my code.

Reading code is something that I need to improve. I do like to read examples of code, especially when they are combined 
with explanations, but there is always more that I could review.

Testing code frequently is something that I have been doing fairly often. One problem that I have is that I have sometimes
tested code after writing a lot out, and I then test and re-test after making small edits. I could improve on this by doing 
many tests throughout writing code.

Committing frequently is definitely the area in which I need to improve most. I have been getting better at this, and I feel that
throughout using Git workflow, I have been writing meaningful commit messages. However, initially I did not commit often. 
This is something I need to keep consistent.

Overall, I need to continue to use my skills in writing code that is easy to follow with using meaningful variables and proper 
syntax, as well as to address issues with Git workflow. Git workflow has caused me the most trouble thus far, so it is an 
area for constant improvement.
