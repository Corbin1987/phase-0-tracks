					<td>The Highs</td>
					<td>Battling other gigantic human controlled warfare robots while in your own customized one is just an awesome concept. Who wouldn't want to travel in one's personal, walking, armored tank? Did I mention that they could boost their jumps with rechargeable thrusters?</td>
					<td>The music, the epic storyline, the seemingly endless area of land to explore, the quests (and the rewards!), and so much more makes this game such an awesome RPG. The Daedric weapons were always a favorite.</td>
					<td>The hauntingly beautiful introductory song sets a tone for a thrilling and sinister adventure as one ultimately faces Metal Gear Rex. The Codec conversations could also be dubbed in Japanese, just for fun.</td>
					<td>The very first Halo is such a fond memory for me. Hours of battles against each other with my siblings, taking down the Flood in cooperative mode, and of course the awesome soundtrack are all fantastic.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>The Lows</td>
					<td>The rechargeable thrusters, though rechargeable, didn't always have quite enough to get you across that canyon or whatever it was before you plummeted and cursed in vain.</td>
					<td>You could play this for hours and hours, but your parents wouldn't let you.</td>
					<td>The alert theme soundtrack when the guards catch you is still burned in my memory, but it's also cool sounding.</td>
					<td>That level where you find out about the Flood is scary enough to make you scream like a two year old.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Things I'd like to see</td>
					<td>More options for customization of your AC unit. It's like having lots of clothes in your closet, except the shirts are generators, the pants are tank treads, jumpy legs, and some others, and there's a slew of different weapons instead of accessories.</td>
					<td>Ash statues! Even though these were a sign of The Blight and worship of Dagoth Ur (bad things, essentially), they made a great decoration in your house.</td>
					<td>A Metal Gear Solid movie. Maybe this has been made, but I don't know. I think there was a Halo movie</td>
					<td>More vehicle options, since apparently I always tried to run over my enemies and found that this was my favorite method of combat.</td>
