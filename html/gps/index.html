	<p>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</p>
	<p>The HTML semantic tags are used to divide sections on a webpage. It is considered good practice to use these as dividers of content and to organize content into appropriate groups. When used with screenreader software, a semantic tag will indicate divisions of content and will notify the user what type of division it is.</p>
	<p>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?<p>
	<p>A browser will display elements in a top to bottom, left to right fashion unless sections are styled individually or repositioned with CSS.</p>
	<p>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</p>
	<p>The snippet function was not entirely new to me, but I had no idea that a user could create his/her own snippet. I liked using these, but I would prefer to be able to memorize tags instead of copying/pasting them with snippets. If I had a table format that I really liked, perhaps I would use a snippet for that.</p>
	<p>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</p>
	<p>Although I really enjoy making them, I find tables to be the most difficult part of HTML. I have to use a browser to test how the table will look as I am working on it. The structure of how they appear on a web browser versus how they appear in HTML throws me off a bit. I think continued practice will of course be helpful, as well as to remind myself of how the table will look as I write its structure. Keeping this in mind as I write the entire table has been helpful as opposed to trying to decipher a structure after creating the table format.</p>
