// Corbin Via: DBC Week 7.2 Data Structures

//In your new file, declare two separate arrays:
// an array of four colors ("blue", for instance, though you're welcome to get crazy with something like "iridescent blue/green with silver sparkles")
// an array of four names that you might give a horse ("Ed" is always a solid choice to start with)
// Write additional code that adds another color to the colors array, and another horse name to the horses array.

// Release 0

var colorsArray = ["blue", "red", "green", "yellow"];

var namesArray = ["Mr. Ed", "Flash Lightning", "Corbin", "Marvan"];

colorsArray.push("purple");

console.log(colorsArray);

namesArray.push("Ed Junior");

console.log(namesArray);
