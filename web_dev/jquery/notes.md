<!-- Create a Markdown file called notes.md in phase-0-tracks/web_dev/jquery (you'll have to create the directory as well). Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.
 -->
<!-- Time to execute your plan. Aaaand ... go! When the time is up, record in notes.md which strategies seemed to be the most effective.

<!-- Make a jQuery project and add it to the jquery directory. It can be tiny, and it can do whatever you like, as long as you can say in good faith that you're practicing what you've learned and improving your jQuery skills.

#Corbin Via: DBC Week 9.3 Assignment

*Plans to tackle jQuery:
	*Research online through Google.
	*Do exercises on Codecademy.
	*Research examples and compare to existing knowledge.
	*Research examples on W3schools.com.
	*Do practice examples as often as possible.
	*Test jQuery on personal webpage (through GitHub).
	*Don't forget to take breaks!

*Why I should do this:
	*Learning about jQuery through one resource is helpful, but there could be other resources that would present information in a different light.
	*Doing exercises will help to solidify my knowledge on jQuery while also helping me to learn the syntax.

*Post research:
	*I didn't make it to Codecademy after studying for a couple hours because I got stuck on W3schools.com. So far, this site has been one of my favorites for online references to coding.
	*I plan to try Codecademy and other sources as I continue research. There is still so much to learn!
	*I found that practicing examples after I learned something was most helpful. On W3schools.com, there were examples after each section that demonstrated a property of what was just discussed. Each example allowed for editing in a web-based editor.
	*I think one of my favorite jQuery effects was the animate function. I have been wanting to try animating something on a website for some time.
	*I did take breaks during my research, but they were longer than I expected. Whoops! Law And Order: SVU kept calling my name.
