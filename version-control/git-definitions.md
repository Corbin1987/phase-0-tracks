# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control means that there are saved versions of the same software, usually differentiating slightly due to improvements or new features, without the software being entirely rewritten. This allows developers to work on an existing version of software while keeping previous versions for reference, and also without having to start over in writing software.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch allows for a user to work on a file while keeping the original software intact. Both versions of the software are stored, and it shows a timeline of edits that were made. Branching is used to differentiate the edits that are made to software.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit allows the user to store a version of code/files to a Git account, along with the option to write a comment on that version. A comment should be meaningful and contain a summary of changes to allow the user to remember what he/she changed in the file.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when a user edits the same line in a file on different branches, or when a user tries to merge a branch where the file was deleted.
