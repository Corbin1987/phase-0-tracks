How might you design a Puppy class? What sorts of characteristics and behavior might a Puppy class involve? 
Using a format similar to the one we used for Eyelashus Adorableus, come up with some characteristics and 
behavior for a Puppy class. 
Use comments to add your class design to phase-0-tracks/ruby/puppy.rb.

# Puppy class! (exclamation point added to enhance cuteness)
# Class design would include: favorite names, famous puppies, puppy abilities (running, tail-wagging, excited
# wiggling, rolling over, making unexpected puddles).
# Class design would also include: other puppy abilities such as fetching, sitting, staying, and rolling over 
# as inherent puppy methods.
# Class design might also include puppy attributes such as: four legs, a tail, adorable eyes to which you can't
# say no, and a beautiful puppy smile.
